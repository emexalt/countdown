# Countdown letters game visual

This is (currently) a visual display to aid in playing the "letters game" from the Channel 4 television series *Countdown* on a video conferencing call or online video stream. Given a number of vowels, it returns a row of nine letter tiles, from which words can be made.

In this version:
+ Any number of vowels <= 9 can be requested before generating the puzzle.
+ The letters in the puzzle will display in a shuffled order, as if chosen one at a time as is done in the television program.
+ The availability of letters follows the Scrabble distribution, rather than the published *Countdown* distribution found [here](http://www.thecountdownpage.com/letters.htm); expect this to change soon.
